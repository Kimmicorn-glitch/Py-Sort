## üéØ How to Contribute

### 1. Choose an Issue

Look for issues labeled with:
- `good first issue` - Perfect for beginners
- `help wanted` - Community contributions welcome
- `bug` - Fix a problem
- `enhancement` - Add a new feature

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow the existing code style
- Test your changes

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_file_organizer.py

# Run with verbose output
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: brief description of your changes"
```

**Commit Message Guidelines:**
- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Be descriptive but concise
- Reference issues: "Fix #123" or "Closes #456"

### 6. Push and Create a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:
- Clear title and description
- Reference to related issues
- Screenshots if applicable

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8 (Python style guide)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused

### Example Good Code:

```python
def organize_files(directory_path: str, dry_run: bool = False) -> None:
    """
    Organize files in the specified directory.
    
    Args:
        directory_path: Path to the directory to organize
        dry_run: If True, only show what would be moved
    """
    directory = Path(directory_path)
    
    if not directory.exists():
        print(f"Error: Directory '{directory_path}' does not exist.")
        return
    
    # Rest of the function...
```

### Example Bad Code:

```python
def org(d, dr=False):  # Unclear names
    # No docstring
    p = Path(d)  # Unclear variable name
    if not p.exists():  # No error handling
        return
    # etc...
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new functionality
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the existing test structure

### Test Structure

```python
def test_function_name_what_it_tests(self):
    """Test that function_name does what it should do."""
    # Arrange - set up test data
    test_data = "example"
    
    # Act - call the function
    result = function_name(test_data)
    
    # Assert - check the result
    self.assertEqual(result, expected_value)
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=py_sort

# Run specific test
python -m pytest tests/test_file_organizer.py::TestFileOrganizer::test_get_file_extension
```
